WARN B3: token accounting is UNVERIFIED
WARN B4: token accounting is UNVERIFIED
WARN B5: token accounting is UNVERIFIED
SUMMARY ok=10 warn=5 fail=0
```

Interpretation:

- The baseline structure is currently coherent.
- Token accounting remains intentionally marked weak/UNVERIFIED for B1-B5 and
  should be improved for B6+.
